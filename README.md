# FPV RC Drift Car
This project is my first ever RC build, an indoor drift car with an FPV camera. I chose to build it since I wanted to learn about the inner workings of RC vehicles, and because I'm a huge car enthusiast. Through this project, I learned about motors, controllers, servos, CAD design, and more. :)

This car will be RWD, with smooth wheels (no traction) for drifting, and a single motor mounted to the rear axle. The front axle will be steered by two servos. It will also be powered by a 3S LiPo battery, which will be mounted to the rear of the car.

This car will not need any custom firmware, since the components come with it built-in, and I will be using ExpressLRS, which is a free and open-source firmware for RC receivers.

# Components  
Refer to the parts list at [BOM.csv](https://github.com/a-finance-bro/fpv-drift-car/blob/main/BOM.csv).  
  
For the latest, updated version of the BOM, see here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Lv73VUDTXfWE0b1IzYuDMYUU8_JK1C5DVHMVwzFLLAM/edit?gid=0#gid=0
  
This project's total funding request is $40.16. The total cost to build this project without borrowing an RC controller, FPV receiver, and battery is likely much higher, potentially upwards of $300 (an estimate for the parts I'm using is provided in the BOM).
